# PDF.js Mini Viewers (PMV)
PDF.js Mini Viewers offers a completely different web viewer experience than the one that comes with the [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) library natively. PMV is designed to be an easy drop-in for any project or website that needs the ability to display PDFs. PMV was originally created for use with the [JamsEDU](https://github.com/caboodle-tech/jams-edu) application to easily embedded multiple PDFs in a single page.

PMV is licensed as: MIT

## PDF.js (PDFJS)
[PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer built with HTML5; PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla.

PDFJS is licensed: Apache-2.0
